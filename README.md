This program is a further optimzed version of my [Mandelbrot set viewer for the C64](https://github.com/rmsk2/c64_mandelbrot) that
makes use of commander X16 features like:

- More RAM which offers the possibility to precalculate more stuff
- More free zero page addresses which allow a broader use of more efficient addressing modes
- More colours to use in Hires mode (256 for the X16, 2 for the C64)
- New instructions for the 65C02 (well only stz and bra)

**This is work in progress**.
